A CLI application built with Ink, React, and TypeScript.

## Getting Started

```

2. Run in development mode:

```bash
npm run dev
```

3. Build the project:

npm run build
```

4. Run the built version:

```bash

## Development

- The main entry point is `src/index.tsx`
- Use `npm run dev` for development with hot reloading
- The project uses TypeScript for type safety
- Ink components are used for rendering the CLI interface
